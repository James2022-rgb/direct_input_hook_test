## Building

Use CMake to generate the *.sln file.

e.g.
```bash
$ cd direct_input_example
$ mkdir build
$ cmake -S . -B build
```

Open the generated *.sln file in Visual Studio and build the project, or use the following command to build the project from the command line:
```bash
$ cmake --build build
```
